# ssh-onion
fully automates ssh onion creation: to allow remote ssh access without having to open any ports on router/firewall.

Only those you share the onion address with will be able to ssh if you block ssh locally/do not open firewall/router port forward.

After created, onion address prints to screen.

(originally created to remotely help friends by shell - but can be used to automate ssh onion creation for anyone)
